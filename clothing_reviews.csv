861,"I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim"

861,"I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews."
861,"I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back."
861,"At first i wasn't sure about it. the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought. but after wearing it, it really is comfortable. it stretches a lot, so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso."
861,This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
861,"The perfect striped t-shirt, and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different. i love it!"
861,"In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section, and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft, thin and stretchy. it's super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little, especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i'm happy with it though for what it is - a great, casual day t."
861,
861,This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.
861,"I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute, but it is not ""red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color, which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back."
861,"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the ""red"" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed"
861,"Really loved this - so soft and snuggly. was unsure about ordering shirt size - (s) or jacket size for layering (m). ordered a small. fits perfect! definitely wouldn't have wanted the medium. 5'4, 135 lbs for reference. love this one!!! great find."
861,Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.
861,"I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too."
861,"This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10"", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer."
861,"This top is so cute! love the stripes in the red print and the detailing of the buttons. however, it does run slightly big! i'm 5'8"", 145 and got the medium. it's so low in the front that i do have to wear a cami underneath. i see why they designed it a little larger since it comes up on the sides and it's supposed to be more of a relaxed fit. i typically love when shirts are long since i'm a little taller and this one hits perfectly in the front. it does dip down in the back and covers my bum ("
861,"I love this tee, it is comfortable and soft with the nice detail of buttons at the shoulders, a good v-neck, and subtle stripes. however it runs quite long! i thought i ordered the petite but i received a regular length tee and it was down to my thighs. so order a petite unless you are quite tall or like a tee to fall that low over your hip area."
861,"I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made, super soft, and works well with jeans, capris, skirts, and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though, this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a"
861,"I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size, medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight, casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder."
861,"Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5"" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special."
861,"Good quality shirt. cute design and not sheer. not quite as loose and stretchy as most of retailer's shirt, but good fit."
861,"I love the button details on this top. i was expecting the material to be thicker, but it's quite thin. it isn't sheer, but i will layer it for the winter months. overall the fit is true to size. i am 5'0, 110 lbs and the xxs fit me well. the arms were more snug than shown on the model and the shirt was loose without being too flowy or boxy."
861,"Fabric is soft and comfy, color is true to photo. the arms are a little tight now and i haven't washed it yet so i am a bit worried but still a keeper."
861,"I love this top!! in fact if it came in more colors, i'd buy a few more. it's just so soft and comfortable, wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights. the neckline is perfect, love the subtle details. it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath. yes, i love it, just wish there were more colors."
861,
861,Material is too thin and quality is poor
861,"This is a cute shirt, but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular ""flap."" it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason."
861,
861,"This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which, for me, defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd), so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off."
861,"I am 5 '4"", 124lbs, and 36 c - usually take a small or sometimes a medium in t.la tops. this top seems to run particularly large as i ended up with an xs."
861,"Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small, but the xsm worked better for me with this top."
861,"Every spring/summer i look forward to t.la's tanks & tees and stock up on them. sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online, but this top (i bought it in green) is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online. the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee (just keeps getting softer wash after wash) and the silver buttons on the side (what a unique twist to an everyday tee). now all i need is the blue one."
861,T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.
861,"This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost."
861,"I love the cut and ""swing"" of this tee. the royal blue is very saturated and pretty."
861,"This brand always makes the softest tees, and so i buy several each season. when i saw this one online, i worried that it might be too long for my short waist, but i decided to order it anyway. success! i ordered my usual size m (for knit tops - 10/12 in fitted ones), and the length was perfect due to the buttons on the side.
fyi: short waist, broad shoulders/back, 36c - i carry my weight in the middle, since i virtually do not have a waistline. so a longer, boxy tee will emphasize the parts of"
861,I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.
861,"This is a cute top, but not worth the price in my opinion. i love the colors, pattern and soft material used. however, the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $58."
861,"I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy), but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee, but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said, i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it."
861,
861,I did size up on this one. it came in and it was too snug for a loose shirt. i sized up and i love it now. i went to the store and bought it in white and black. i sized up in the white but not the black. you may want to try them on before purchasing them. i want more.
861,I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.
861,"I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight, but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently, nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric, i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded, and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4"", weigh 134 lbs, and do typically wear size medium."
861,I bought this tee in purple. went back the next day and purchased the peach! this is a classic tee with a girly twist! cute with jeans and a jean jacket!
861,"I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever, thus far, they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut, and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees, and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)"
861,"I saw this tee and was unsure about the print, but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did, as it has become a weekend staple."
861,
861,Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.
861,
861,"This top was very pretty when i got it, but i was hoping it would be a bit longer. the v neck design was nice, and the fabric very soft. i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine."
861,"I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering, lightweight, gorgeous color, cool raw edges, v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top, but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa."
861,"Fit is okay, the style of the shirt and the purple flowers are beautiful!"
861,"I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine, the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it."
861,Great shirt.  love the detail in back.  feminine and different than the average t
861,"Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered,' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft, true fit, and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'"
861,"Nicer twist on the casual tshirt. soft, comfy. love the purple."
861,"This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use. 
touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt. 
although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything. 
just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size."
861,I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work. it's very comfortable and light.
861,
861,"I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal."
861,I like this shirt and think its very feminine.
861,"I am wearing a medium in the photos, my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference."
861,"This top is true to size, although i am a little nervous about washing it... hopefully it won't shrink. it is super think so great for hot days but because it's so thin, i'll be careful. i have white and am def. going to get more colors. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i think medium might cut to low in the v, but haven't tried it yet, let's just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium..."
861,"Very soft and lovely t-shirt. beautiful flowered print and cute detail on neck. i am 140 lbs and 5' 4"" and got a large."
861,"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"".
it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well."
861,"I bought this top in 2 colors -- white and light green. i really like them both. the shirt is a nice weight and texture and the soft green color is really nice. the fit is true to size. i am 5'-6"" and 145 lbs. and the medium was perfect. i like how the back dips in a slight v as well."
861,"I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length, i'm 5'8"" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry, no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!"
861,I think 56 reviews says it all! basic tee with a little tailoring on upper back in a variety of colors. i purchased the purple floral tee in my local store and it is prettier in person than on the website. much more vibrant in color. it is tts.
861,Tts and comfortable. this t shirt brings flair to everyday wear and i purchased on sale for a steal!
861,"I usually wear a small or a medium in tee shirts, and i had to get a medium so that it fit comfortable throughout the shoulder area."
861,"I got this in light green and it's a gorgeous color. first tried a small, but it was a little too wide and long. exchanged for xs, looks great. now i just hope it doesn't shrink too much!"
861,"I tried this shirt in the purple motif, it fit true to size, my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt."
861,I'm dying for this skirt in the picture. where is it??
861,"I bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated. i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy. i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame. i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online. sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store, but it's usually from a return."
861,"I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer, and this is not it. like others, it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps, but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.

- the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however,"
861,"When i walked into the store, this tee instantly caught my eye. it's light weight, not too low cut and longer in the back. great with jeans, skirts or shorts."
861,"I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i didn't want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it's not too thin, nor see-through."
861,"I have bought several tees by t.la and this one is really cute. i bought it in the blue stripe size xs. it runs slightly larger than most in that size, but it will probably shrink a little. it's not overly baggy, just comfy fit. i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans. the fabric is thin so i'm not sure how long it will last, but until then it will be a keeper in my closet!"
861,"Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer."
861,The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.
861,Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!
861,"I got the black in size small. i love this easy, breezy and comfy t. i love that it's different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer. 

i'm a size 2 and bought a small."
861,
861,Love this tshirt! casual but can be dressed up with wedges and a scarf!
861,"I love the cold shoulder trend, and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue, which is really more like a very light mint green. however, i think the material is pretty thin (though soft), and the keyhole sleeve area, right by the twist, is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small, but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds, 32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price, thou"
861,"I love this shirt but have 1 issue- that darn pocket. it's so awkward. it even looks awkward on the model. then, i bought another t-shirt by the same company from elsewhere and guess what? same awkward weird floppy pocket. it's so odd, i can't even explain it."
861,I love this t shirt and have not purchased it in all 3 colors. very soft and very flattering!!! i like the longer length as well as the pretty neckline.
861,"This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style, and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before, and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer, softer, and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w"
861,"Cute tee shirt but it runs very large.i ordered a small and probably an xxs would have fit.unfortunately i have to return it.for reference i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs."
861,T.la has another winner in my book. i decided on the blue and thrilled with the tee. it's a soft blue almost light periwinkle. fabric isn't so thin so it not see through. thank goodness. i actually love it so much i'm ordering the other color as well. i absolutely would recommend this cute tee. love love t.la.
861,"I love this brand and their different styles of tshirts. extremely soft, washes well and wears well! the shirt runs a bit large and i usually wear a medium, but in this brand i am a extra small or small."
861,"I love this tee, i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered 2 of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium."
861,This is better than the original tla t shirts from last summer. better quality/not sheer. great fit! i bought both the white and the purple. love tla tees!
861,"This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white, which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color, but i returned it since it was nothing special."
861,Purchased the xs blue. love the fit and light material. perfect casual tee for warm weather. no shrinkage after washing in cold water and minimal wrinkles when hung immediately.
861,T la is such a great brand for t shirts! this one is so soft and comfy and the yellow color is a great neutral yellow.
861,I bought this tee in most of the colors available. that's how much i liked it. it's not tissue thin; it's a good medium weight. it does't hug the body too closely. i am 5'4 and 140 lbs with a little post partum belly and this is a really flattering tee in m.
861,"Easy, breezy comfortable light weight tee"
861,"Incredibly soft, great to dress up or dress down. i must have summer tee."
861,"I picked up this tee in store, where they had a pattern that isn't pictured here (purple floral on a grey background). this is a loose fitting tee, and usually the loose fitting tees i try on at retailer are really unflattering- however, this one fits great and is flattering. the fabric is wrinkle resistant and comfortable. this top will definitely be a staple of my spring and summer wardrobe! considering ordering in other colors.

for reference, i'm 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 measurements, 34ddd"
861,"A perfect basic tee!
loved how soft it is. not worth full price, but definitely one to add to your cart once on sale."
861,"I've never bought a tee at full price, in so many colors. i love this tee.it's quite possibly the most perfect fit ever. the material is thick and hangs well without being stiff or bulky. i'm 5'2 -117lbs usually a small petite or 4p but purchased the regular small so i can wear this with skinny or regular jeans. i purchased the purple, navy and black and may go back for the yellow. the white is still a little too sheer fir me otherwise i would have purchased it. wish they had a light grey versio"
861,"I love these t.la tees, and i buy them often. i find them to be very versatile and super soft. i have several colors and they hold up well if you wash and hang dry. i am a small in most retailer tops and these are no exception. they wear well under jean jackets or even a long-sleeve button-down shirt."
861,I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.
861,"I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo"
861,"I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white, but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked."
861,"I love this t-shirt! it is so soft, fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts. i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors!"
861,"I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7"", 115lbs i prefe"
861,I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!
861,"I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online, and decided to order it. the fabric is soft, but strong, and the color is just as pictured. perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends."
861,"I absolutely adore this shirt, it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans! i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount. i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe."
861,Love this top! the length is perfect and it is very stylish! hope it will come in other colors because i would buy more!!
861,I'm an employee and bought this top today. i'm so happy i ended up buying it on a whim! it's adorable and super comfy! it's perfect for those jeans and a tee day! i can't wait to wear it to work. the color is gorgeous and the peplum adds a feminine detail without being too puffy...in love!
861,"I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however, the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5"", 125#, 34c), but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally, the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l"
861,I seldom take anything but a size m in retailer tops. this m top fits ok but it is a bit sloppy overall. one reviewer says it is 'body skimming' but not on me. i am a true m yet a m seems to fit in the shoulders but overall just too big. i love the fabric and print however i will exchange for a size s if it is available. it does hide the tummy area but ends up looking like a pajama top on me.
861,"Wonderfully soft fabric and gorgeous pattern. the background color is a more standard gray than shows in the on-line photo (which looks more pinkish gray on my screen), but it's just lovely -- looks perfect with jeans or a skirt. i will be wearing this a lot this fall, and will keep a lookout for additional patterns!"
861,"Great tee! the color online is lighter and nicer in my opinion than in reality. it's much darker in real life, but otherwise it's a super soft tee with gently fluttered sleeves and side slits. i bought it in a s and it's roomy without being oversized. great for fall...."
861,"I love the paisley print, very soft and comfy, flutter sleeve look is cute,perfect weekend wear."
861,"This shirt has beautiful colors in it. it goes with burgundy, grey, black, brown, blues, and denim. it's a generous cut, and quite lightweight for fall layering."
861,"T.la makes the best tees. soft feel, sophisticated color layering, and a body skimming shape -- all retained after multiple washings. versatile, too. other tees fade, stretch out, shrink. not t.la. a gem."
861,"This tee is my favorite this year! it just looks great on! not fitted, but not loose either. i love it so much i have it in white, black, pink, light green, gray, slate blue and holly. the holly was my least favorite color (i thought it would look a little 'greener') it is so dark, you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green. i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just because...

i love the fact that it can be machine warned and dried without shrinking. i don't dr"
861,"The fabric is thin, though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!"
861,Great soft tee. got the blue and really love the color.
861,These shirts are perfect for a casual day. basically t.la shirts are my daily go to. i usually wear a small but i buy these in medium because i like the looser fit. a little pricey so after buying 1 at full price i waited until they were on sale to buy more.
861,"I do love this shirt as i am a yogi and love to wear things like this. it was a little boxy and big, but don't care because the style of it is so cute."
861,Love the cute print and texture of fabric. perfect casual t-shirt.
861,"I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it. i am usually a m/size 10 but as this tee is fairly sheer, i did better exchanging for a large. the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable. a must have for yogis!"
861,This print is so cool! the shirt is just a little loose so order your usual size and it will fit perfectly.
861,"The design is so cute (people in different yoga poses, small and subtle prints) and a must for a yogini. i love the colors, it's colorful but not too bright and it's beautiful against the white background. i ordered xs (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fit perfectly (it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material). i like the fact that there's no stretchy spandex feel, just pure soft cotton feel. it's great for gals who are conscious about the arms"
861,I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.
861,
861,"I got this in black and it's a great basic t-shirt- the v-neck is just right in depth, and the material is very soft and lightweight. the fit is good. the back is long, which can be good or not-so-good depending on how you want to wear it. i really like the la t shirts because the material has a nice soft drape and they seem to fit exceptionally well."
861,I ordered this online. it's fine. i am usually a small in tops and it fits true to the size. good material. no complaints. looks good layered.
861,"I really like this top.  for reference, i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large, however, in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely.  in any brand other than retailer, my usual size is m as i am 36d bust, 132 lbs., 5""5."
861,Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price
861,"I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose. i love it! the bottom hem is slightly flared, but does not look like a maternity tee. i'm going to wear this with a fun scarf, skinnies and colorful flats! this tee is a must!"
861,"This is really my favorite top! i wear it all the time, like every day. it's so soft, a beautiful rich color (blue), has nice detailing, and so flattering on a hot momma like me who still has a little tummy from my three lovely children. snuck it in to my dressy office on a friday as well - with a conservative skirt and high heels. only downside is the lack of other nice colors. the stripe isn't cutting it. got my regular xs and it fits perfectly."
861,"Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric, wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel ""well dressed"" in this top. i returned it."
861,"I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short."
861,"The white is completely sheer. i am so tired of see through shirts!! even at the sale on top of sale prices, i wouldn't recommend this shirt. if the fabric weren't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back. but it just looks silly with a tank top under it, the cotton just doesn't lay right."
861,I bought this top in black and love it! the crossed straps in the back give it a stylish twist. i also tried it in white and found it to be a little see thru.
861,"I was hoping not to like this tee so that i can be $48 richer (lol). it's very cute. i would say runs true, but more on the smaller side. i usually wear xs and it's a good cut for me. it's not boxy at all. i love the strap detail on this tee. i hope the quality will hold up. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs (2/4)."
861,"I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it's not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top, but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. it doesn't look great when i do a half tuck, but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit."
861,"I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back."
861,"This shirt is incredibly soft! i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back. definitely size down. the sleeves were a little snug, but sizing down will help with the length and the bust. my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over, anyone can see down your top. so be aware! otherwise, the top is great and perfect for summer."
861,"As far as t-shirts go, this one is fun, i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs, 30dd), the shirt flares out (swing), so it can be a little much on the smaller gals, but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty, but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer, must be the trend..."
861,"This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small."
861,"I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price, they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim, pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right, and the tag sewn inside, was sewn with red thread and showed through, very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev"
861,"I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!"
861,"It's thin, very. but i were a cute scrappy athletic type bra underneath and it's so cute!
it's a stink top, i pick a spot to tuck in around the from and let the rest flow.
aside from being a swing top, it runs large. i have 2 in xs and i'm a 34dd and i still have room.
i have it in faded red/pink and white and am buying blue too, love it!"
861,"I absolutely love this top. it can be worn with shorts or jeans, dressed up or down. it fits perfectly, i am broad on top so i ordered a large. i bought it in white..i wish they had more colors. love it."
861,I bought this top in every color. the fit is so flattering and just flows so nicely - not too big. love!
861,
861,"I ordered this in the blue, it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back, but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top, but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted, 34-d, 5'3, 125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person."
861,"Super flattering, a great length for me (5'9"") but very sheer."
861,"While shopping with my daughters, i bought this tee in white. i immediately felt guilty for spending too much on a white tee that was thin and see-through enough that i'd need to wear something underneath. i returned the white, but then retailer had a sale weekend, so i ordered the blue with a discount, so less guilt and the color is beautiful. i don't need to worry about wearing anything underneath - the fabric is very thin and super soft and feels so nice."
861,"I adore a well made and well fit tshirt. t.la always delivers! this one is no exception. fun, swingy and light. the tie on back is a fun little addition and the length is perfect. i'm 5'9 and always prefer longer tops. the swing in this one gives it a great length. love the colors but decided to stick with basic white. i'd love this in black too! highly recommend!"
861,"Great summer shirt, loose and casual. it's pretty flowy and not form-fitted at all. i almost always wear a petite xs in retailer, and that is what i got (i'm 5'4 and 125 pounds). fits great- loose and swingy, but is big (i like this). retailer, please get/restock petites for the pink color!"
861,Love this top...bought in 2 colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.
861,"I was thrilled when this shirt arrived.  it is as cute in person as in the catalog.  it's soft, it fit perfect, and it looks great with shorts and pants.  it will be my ""go to"" shirt this summer."
861,I would describe as an upgraded t-shirt. a perfect flowy top that you can dress up or down. comfortable and soft material.
861,Super cute t-shirt keep in mind to is fairly long
861,"I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time."
861,"Love this, it's a great update your basic tee!"
861,"Love this t-shirt, its comfortable and very cute. it runs a little large i am 5'0 110 pounds and got a xs. 
the color is a little brighter than the picture."
861,The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
861,The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.
861,"I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty, even so, not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person..."
861,"This tunic is just adorable. material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory. i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color, perfect for spring. the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touch.
fit is tts. i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly. i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in"
861,"Love the lilac purple color, breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin. i like the small detail cut out in the back, and a high bonus point for not showing your bra. one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back, but not a big deal."
861,"I brought this shirt for a vacation, it fitted well and was flattering. totally a comfortable wear, however, after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom. i am hoping i can return it. not worth the money."
861,"Very cute, but i would not call it pink. it's more of a melon color."
861,"I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me, it's not a flattering cut."
861,"I usually love tops like this, i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in."
861,"After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors, i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin, so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!"
861,This is a great everyday top that is very versatile.
861,"Yes, this top is not of the best quality but i bought it on sale with an additional 25% off. it has a very cute design on the back and will be cute on while running errands on a hot day. it's true to size: i'm 5'6"", 150 lbs and m fit well."
861,"That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute, but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows, and the string is at least 3 feet too long. 
not bad, i wear it with white gauze pants, looks nice. good with leggings too."
861,"I got a medium as i usually wear that in everything. i am a 36d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back. it is a cute idea, but the fit is off for my body. i am 5'6 and hits me shorter than shown on the model, so hits at an odd length. i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me, because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me! the teal blue color is beautiful, the pink is more a blush and washed me out, the grey is just grey. i bought three thinking this would be my go t"
861,"I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful, drab actual color."
861,"I love the look and feel of the material, but it was way too short - i don't even have a long torso! sadly, it's going back to the store."
861,"I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model, but it was a cropped length on me :("
861,"The tee looks longer on the model. i am 5 feet 9 and this tee is showing of my belly which surprise me a bit. i thought it would hit the waist line. still, very nice tee, i love cotton, it simply is the best. colors are nice too."
861,The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
861,
861,"Color was a perfect match for the linen slacks i wanted to pair it with, however the top was way, say too big so i'll be sending it back."
861,"It's a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model, not clingy at all. it should be noted that it's fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that's close to skin color it's not an issue, but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath, but it's too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall, i'm very happy with this, though i'm also very very happy i got thi"
861,I loved this t-shirt. i got the grey one in small. i'm a size 2 and 5'3. it is a relaxed fit. i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair. i didn't want t plan t shirt but i also didn't want anything too crazy. fits well and is soft too.
861,"This is a very nice quality t-shirt. i loved the material & colors. i got it on sale and the only reason i had to return it because it was small on me. due to the nice sale, another size was not available."
861,"When i saw this shirt, i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers, and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2"" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin, so i hope it stays in good shape. until then, i can't wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days."
861,"I love flowers! i love flowers on my basic tees even better! simple,comfy,but different from your every day plain old tee!"
861,Love the color and the design. it is slightly see-through which i don't like but it still works wotb a nude bra. very comfortable!
861,
861,
861,"The tee is adorable in the floral print. the fit is true to size, as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted. the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail. i would have bought this at full price, but it is quite see through in the white/yellow floral. i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer. having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute, casual tee you can just throw on. i was so disappointed that it was so sheer. i think the"
861,I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.
861,"Cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs. sizing is ridiculous. and now that i have an xs that is too big, the xxs are sold out. typical."
861,"This is casual and comfortable.
along with soft touch of its textile, i also like the pastel color of flower prints. 
especially, i love the purple flower print with grey background (which is sold out already).
it also fits well with my body and makes look cool. 

it is perfect for everyday use."
861,"This color came out after i had purchased the same in the gray motif. when i saw this one, though, i simply had to have it! it is such a happy print and different color scheme from anything else in my closet. i had purchased the gray one in regular only because the petites were all sold out, but i was able to get this one in my usual small petite size. it is most definitely a better fit/length for me. i don't usually like to pay so much for a t-shirt, but i will splurge for something like this t"
861,"I love this t-shirt, i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft, almost feels lived in, and high quality all the same."
861,"Tshirt is beautiful. looks like watercolor. the fabric is a thin soft cotton that is really nice. i am 5'6"" and very thin. xs fit well and was not too short. s would have been fine too. i would choose a size by your shoulder width. i bought my mother the medium."
861,Very soft! i sized up. was able to wear without a cami underneath
861,I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.
861,"It's a t-shirt. a very cute print, nice cut, very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore, why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it, but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.

for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer, and the medium fit well."
861,"Love this shirt! i love florals so the bright pretty yellow just had to be mine. it is true to size, perfect neckline- not too low or high and very flattering. see through enough to require a cami, but worth it. very soft fabric and really comfy."
861,"I got the xs and it fits perfectly, almost an a line cute slightly fuller on the bottom, not too form fitting and not too loose. i am 5'1"" and the length is not short as it appears in the photo on the model. the yellow flower pattern is super cute. material is soft and comfy."
861,This tee is very pretty - i purchased it in the grey/purple combo. i usually wear a medium in this brand just because i don't like my tees to be fitted but i found this one to be a little too loose for me so i should have sized down to a small.
861,"This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size, and not too loose, but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!"
861,"I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a ""cotton-rayon jersey"" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back."
861,"I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much, went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin, it's super soft and just the perfect length."
861,I ordered the yellow. i love this shirt it such a happy print. can match a lot of things.
861,
861,"I don't know why i didn't pay much attention to this tee (the yellow), but i didn't. i saw it in the store, thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it, and no surprise, it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i'm small, i have several tla tees in medium, so i tried on a medium and a small. as"
861,
861,"This t- shirt is adorable. i saw this in the catalog and ordered it immediately- despite the $50 price tag. cute with jeans, khakis, shorts, under a denim jacket, the options are endless. print is very cute but the sizing and quality left something to be desired. the material is extremely thin- it will be a matter of time before holes develop... no matter how careful you are. i ordered a large to be roomy and it was way too big."
861,Such a great purchase! it can be dressed up or down and seems to go with everything! great for summer!
861,"The shirt is darling, soft and relaxed fit. i usually wear an xs or small in most retailer tops. unfortunately, i ordered an xs and should have ordered the small. i found the length to be a little short in the xs so i'm sending it back to exchange for the small. i hope it's just a little bit longer."
861,"I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also."
861,Nice print and comfortable shirt.
861,"Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too, but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger."
861,"Literally the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is because of my history with this brand (holes developing after minimal wear). i will do my usual wash but don't dry and hope it holds up!

material: super soft and comfortable, almost slubby. i haven't seen the yellow in person, the purple/grey is lovely. 

fit: moderate scoop neck as pictured (almost oval) that's a nice touch as it's not too low or high at the neck. not overly fitted over the chest or stomach - without being oversized - j"
861,"I bought the grey version of this shirt in-store because of the cute pattern, soft material, and versatility of wear; you can dress it up for work or wear with jeans/shorts for a more casual look. the beautiful purples, greens, and blues of the roses look like a water color painting, and stand out against the grey background. i've already received multiple complements from co-workers and friends, and liked it so much myself i bought the other two colors! personally i think it runs a bit large, s"
861,"Love the fit, feel and colors of this tee. looks great with white jeans, blue jeans and is so springy. longer in length than most tees which is a plus for me. may run a tad small since i am usually an xs in most tops but i bought a s and love the fit."
861,"I love t-shirts by t la, but unfortunately this particular one was different. the sizing was off. it ran small, although i ordered my usual size medium for this brand. i think the shirt is cute though;)"
861,I really like this brand. i bought the t-shirt in the gray and the red color. the sizing is different for the colors. i kept the gray in a small and had to get a medium in the red color. they wash very nicely.
861,7 months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant. went to a dr. apt and the receptionist loved this shirt. i told her it was non-maternity and she can buy it at retailer... i think she stopped by on her way home from work.
861,Great transition into fall. super soft and comfy. great yellow without being too yellow love it.
861,"I bought yellow one, and i'm very happy with this purchase. the flower print is beautiful, and the material is light, but not too thin. i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottom.
i'm pretty short in height and size 36c. i bought a m in regular size because i like my tops roomy, and it fits really nice, i just tie a small knot on the bottom of this top or tuck the shirt in a little bit, it works perfect."
861,"This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin, but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!"
861,"Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly, cotton, and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt."
861,"I love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!"
861,"I purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time! it is such a lovely soft tee, with a delicate flower design. i wear it with jeans. it always makes me feel happy."
861,"Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!"
861,"This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees, size down. xs works good for me."
861,"I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen."
861,I debated forever about ordering this and so glad i did! the colors are so pretty. i got the yellow and it's slightly sheer but ok w/ a nude bra. regarding fit- completely tts imo. i'm a 8/10 and 38 c and the med is perfect. i am so happy i did not size up.
861,"I bought this t-shirt in pink, blue, red, grey and black over the past year. every one of them except the grey, has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline. i've returned them all. the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible."
861,"I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts, thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well, i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft, a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t, nice fit, not too baggy, not too tight, and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!"
861,Im size 16 top and the xl is a little big but it is a longer tshirt whihc i love thank you sooo much please return the size large back...
861,I love the raw edges on this t-shirt and the marled pink is a pretty color. the fit is not as oversized as you might expect from the photos. order your usual size. it's very soft and lightweight.
861,"It's the perfect long, loose t-shirt. flattering without being fitted. love it!"
861,"This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however, it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7"", 140lbs, 32dd). going back unfortunately."
861,"This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$."
